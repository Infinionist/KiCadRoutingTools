"""Which way a connector OPENS: its mating face, read off its drawn body (#1155).

Before this module the toolchain could say which edge a connector's courtyard
was NEAREST, and nothing else. A connector seated backwards, its shell lying
over the board and its mating face pointing inward, is still nearest the edge
it was declared on whenever the shell's back grazes that edge -- so
`rule_edge_connector`, board_context's "Mating face", check_assembly and
board_score all passed sonde_xilinx's reversed J2 (#1155).

The fact that decides it is where the BODY sits relative to the PAD ROW. A
horizontal or edge-mount connector solders at the back and extends forward to
the opening: a DSUB edge-mount's shell runs 14 mm past its pads, a USB-C
receptacle's 7 mm, a right-angle header's plastic 9 mm. So the mating face
is the direction of the body's centre from the pad bbox's centre, in the
footprint's own frame, mapped through the pose to a board edge.

It abstains -- `face is None`, with a reason -- whenever that reading is not
a fact:

* no pads (nothing for a body to be offset FROM);
* a board-copper plug (`floorplan.is_board_copper_plug`): the BOARD is the
  mating body, and its courtyard points inward by construction (StickHub J1);
* a `Vertical` footprint name: a vertical mount mates perpendicular to the
  board, so it has no in-plane face, however its plastic is drawn (a JST-XH
  vertical courtyard sits 0.5 mm off its pad row);
* no source offset by at least `FACE_MIN_OFFSET_MM` and `FACE_DOMINANCE`
  times its cross-axis offset (a symmetric part: a box header, a terminal);
* sources that disagree (courtyard says north, fab says south: glasgow SW1);
* a pose within 30 degrees of a diagonal.

Two sources vote: the courtyard (when that rung answered) and the drawn body
(`drawn_local`, fab else silk -- AFTER #1201's guard, so a pin-1 dot casts no
vote: unguarded, CM5_MINIMA_3's USB-C J101/USB701 read east off their dots;
guarded, their silk shells read west, which is right). Every decisive vote
must agree.

A face is STRONG when its offset reaches `FACE_STRONG_OFFSET_MM`, and only a
strong face may fail a declared edge at ERROR (`floorplan.edge_facing`); a
weaker one is reported at WARN. The phase verifier swept KiCad's stock
library: right on all 148 footprints that draw a "PCB Edge" marker, but
confidently WRONG on three receptacles whose PAD layout, not their housing,
sets the offset -- CUI SJ1-3533NG (x2, -x at 0.90 mm; its twin SJ1-3535NG,
same housing, reads -y) and Neutrik NMJ6HCD3 (-x at 1.36 mm; the opening is
+x) -- while 60+ correct micro-USB / USB-C faces sit in the same 0.6-1.6 mm
range. Above 2 mm no wrong face is known (227 checked). The marker itself
would be stronger evidence still; reading it is a follow-up.

Known limit: a card-edge PLUG in a file with no `attrs` (interf_u's ISA
BUS1: 62 netted SMD fingers, no model) is not recognised as one, and reads
inward (0.64 mm, weak). Its class is none, so it is graded only when an
author declares it `edge_mount` / `through_edge`.

The board frame uses the sign `connector_geometry.rect` and
`legality.rotate_local_bounds` use, with NO extra mirror for a B-side part:
the board file stores a B-side footprint's local coordinates already mirrored,
measured on sonde_u J2, orangecrab J4 and rp2350 J3.

Measured over the tracked corpus and the fa10 human boards
(`tests/measure_1155_mating_census.py`, fixture
`tests/fixtures/1155_mating_census.json`): every decisive receptacle faces
the edge it is seated on.
