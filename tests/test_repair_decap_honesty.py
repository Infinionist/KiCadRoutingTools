"""#1066: `place_seed --repair` reports a violator repaired only when the grade
error it was CHARGED for is gone.

The repair charges every intent grade error that names a ref (decap_distance,
decap_pin_distance, zones, ...), but `_try_place` searches for the nearest
LEGAL pose and has no intent target, so it accepts the part where it stands.
The run-7 honesty re-grade re-checked pads, holes and containment only, so
each intent-only violator was reported repaired with nothing moved -- glasgow
run 34: "33 violator(s), 33 repaired (0 moved)", floorplan errors 43 -> 43.

What each case pins (esp_prog, `decaps.max_distance_mm = 1.5`, which charges
C3 alone at the human pose: 1.53mm from U2, the regulator it decouples since
#1249 -- before it, the limit was 2.0 and C3 read 2.125mm from U1):

* ZERO MOVE: C3 at its human pose is not moved and is UNRESOLVED, naming
  decap_distance.
* MOVED, STILL FAILING: C3 dropped onto R1's pads is charged for the pad
  conflict AND the decap distance. The repair moves it off R1 -- and it is
  still too far from U2, so it is UNRESOLVED too ("it moved"). Re-grading
  only the zero-move refs (the obvious half-fix) passes the first case and
  fails this one.
* A REAL FIX is still repaired: R2 dropped onto R1 charges one pad conflict,
  the repair moves one of them off it, and that part is reported repaired.
* A charged claim the POSE grader cannot reproduce (it comes from `grade`
  outside the rules loop, so no move can clear it) stays UNRESOLVED.
* A re-grade that RAISES is not a pass: the ref is unresolved and says why.
* A move that CREATES an error is not a repair (the phase-1 verifier's
  counterexample): splitflap with 12 parts displaced, C8 and C12 are moved
  off pad conflicts and out of their decap limits -- unresolved, "created".
* Leaving the decap search radius is not a fix: C3 pushed past a declared
  2mm radius from U2 becomes `decap_ungraded` (warn), and stays unresolved.
* A created `decap_pin_distance` (it names the IC) is charged to the CAP
  whose move stranded the pin, through its measured `cap` -- and, when the
  finding names no moved ref at all, by COUNTERFACTUAL: watchy seed 2's C5
  strands U4 pin 20 under a claim U4 already carried, naming only U4 and C3.
* A finding that only GREW is not "no change": watchy seed 1's C12 move grows
  U3's VBUS pin error 7.78 -> 11.10mm, and C12 is not repaired.
* CLI: `place_seed --repair` writes `violators`, `repaired_refs`,
  `unresolved_refs`, `unresolved_by_rule` (its exit 4 is the final grade's,
  as before), and -- the issue's own regression property -- the refs it
  reports repaired share no member with the refs a FRESH `floorplan.grade` of
  the written board still charges a decap error to.

#1066 (b), the opt-in decap rung (`repair_decaps` / `--repair-decaps`):
splitflap seed 3 -- C2 is seated at its IC and fixed, C8's only fixing pose is
disproportionate and refused; a fixing pose that adds a finding elsewhere is
reverted; the flag needs `--repair` and its record reaches JSON_SUMMARY.
